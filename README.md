# Radical Open Access: Experiments in (Post-)Publishing Symposium
With the demise of traditional gatekeepers, we are witnessing the rapid rise of alternative modes of both scholarly publishing and distribution as well as the artistic exhibition of computer generated works of art in digital environments. The rise of open access and collaborative platforms are in fact blurring the distinctions between publishing as a significant force of cultural activity in both contemporary art and leading-edge academic venues.

In this context, the symposium will question the current corporatized systems of academic publishing and the commercial-driven art museum and upmarket gallery systems, as well as serve as a forum to interrogate new models of collective action for collaborating on, creating, and sharing scholarship and art.

The **Radical Open Access: Experiments in (Post-)Publishing Symposium** will take place at the University of Colorado Boulder in the Center for British and Irish Studies in Norlin Library, on **April 6th from 10:30am - 2pm.** This event will be followed by a "**Clinic for Open Source Arts**," taking place in the Center for Research Data and Digital Scholarship (Norlin E206) from 2-4pm. 

Light refreshments and lunch will be provided. We look forward to seeing you there!

The author of many books – including The End of Man: A Feminist Counterapocalypse (University of Minnesota Press, 2018), Nonhuman Photography (MIT Press, 2017) and Minimal Ethics for the Anthropocene (Open Humanities Press, 2014) – she is also involved in more experimental and collaborative publishing projects, such as Photomediations (Open Humanities Press, 2016). Her own art practice involves playing with different kinds of image-based media.

- **Gary Hall** is Professor of Media in the Faculty of Arts & Humanities at Coventry University, UK, where he co-directs the Centre for Postdigital Cultures, which brings together media theorists, practitioners, activists and artists. In 1999 he co-founded the critical theory journal Culture Machine, an early champion of open access in the humanities, while in 2006 he co-founded Open Humanities Press, the first open access publishing house explicitly dedicated to critical and cultural theory. Recent publications include The Inhumanist Manifesto (Techne Lab, 2017), Pirate Philosophy (MIT Press, 2016) and The Uberfication of the University (Minnesota UP, 2016). He is currently completing a monograph titled Liberalism Must Be Defeated for Joanna Zylinska’s new Media:Art:Write:Now series.

- **Janneke Adema** is Assistant Professor at the Centre for Postdigital Cultures at Coventry University. In her research she explores the future of scholarly communications and experimental forms of knowledge production, where her work incorporates processual and performative publishing, radical open access, scholarly poethics, media studies, book history, cultural studies, and critical theory. She explores these issues in depth in her various publications, but also by supporting a variety of scholar-led, not-for-profit publishing projects, including the Radical Open Access Collective, Open Humanities Press, ScholarLed and Post Office Press (POP). She is also a Co-PI on the Community-Led Open Publication Infrastructures for Monographs (COPIM) project.
