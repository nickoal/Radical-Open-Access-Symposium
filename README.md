# Radical Open Access: Experiments in (Post-)Publishing Symposium

## Friday, 1 October 2021

With the demise of traditional gatekeepers, we are witnessing the rapid rise of alternative modes of both scholarly publishing and distribution as well as the artistic exhibition of computer generated works of art in digital environments. The rise of open access and collaborative platforms are in fact blurring the distinctions between publishing as a significant force of cultural activity in both contemporary art and leading-edge academic venues.

In this context, the symposium will question the current corporatized systems of academic publishing and the commercial-driven art museum and upmarket gallery systems, as well as serve as a forum to interrogate new models of collective action for collaborating on, creating, and sharing scholarship and art. This event has been organised in collaboration with the Post-Publishing programme (https://www.post-publishing.org) at the Centre for Postdigital Cultures (Coventry University, UK), and forms part of a series of symposia exploring contemporary approaches to experimental publishing.

The **Radical Open Access: Experiments in (Post-)Publishing Symposium** will be a hybrid event, with a mix of remote and onsite participation at the University of Colorado Boulder on Friday, 1 October 2021. This event will be followed by a "**Clinic for Open Source Arts (COSA)**." 

Light breakfast, refreshments and lunch will be provided. We look forward to seeing you there!

The author of many books – including The End of Man: A Feminist Counterapocalypse (University of Minnesota Press, 2018), Nonhuman Photography (MIT Press, 2017) and Minimal Ethics for the Anthropocene (Open Humanities Press, 2014) – she is also involved in more experimental and collaborative publishing projects, such as Photomediations (Open Humanities Press, 2016). Her own art practice involves playing with different kinds of image-based media.

In 1999 he co-founded the critical theory journal Culture Machine, an early champion of open access in the humanities, while in 2006 he co-founded Open Humanities Press, the first open access publishing house explicitly dedicated to critical and cultural theory. Recent publications include The Inhumanist Manifesto (Techne Lab, 2017), Pirate Philosophy (MIT Press, 2016) and The Uberfication of the University (Minnesota UP, 2016).

She explores these issues in depth in her various publications, but also by supporting a variety of scholar-led, not-for-profit publishing projects, including the Radical Open Access Collective, Open Humanities Press, ScholarLed, and Post Office Press (POP), and the Research England and Arcadia funded Community-Led Open Publication Infrastructures for Monographs (COPIM) project, on which she is Co-PI.
